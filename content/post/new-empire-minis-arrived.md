First post! For now I am planning to mostly use this blog/web-site to keep track of my miniature
collection. Over years I've collected hundreds of miniatures and I've started to slowly loose
track of what I actually have. So let's start with a new addition to my collection...

Today I've received a package with some Oldhammer goodies - in Poland everything metal is
considered Oldhammer.

-   old metal Hellblaster - it misses Leonardo, but luckily I have one extra in my collection
-   old metal Mortar with full crew
-   25x plastic Halberdiers
-   4x metal Flagellants
-   6x Knights of White Wolf (one without the top of the hammer, but that's something easy to fix)
-   Grand Master of the Knights of White Wolf
-   Mounted Hero with a hammer
-   handful of bits, incl. 3 knight bodies and some extra horses

All models have been added to [my collection]({{< relref "empire" >}}) list.
